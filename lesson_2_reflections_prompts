What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git will initialize an empty repository linked to the directory where the
initialization took place. That is necessary because all meta data that git uses will be stored in that new directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a middle ground between the two where one can put files that will be part of commits in the future. This has the benefit
of not having commits for each file to be added
